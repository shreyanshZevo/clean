make me document over clean architecture of my backend in which add flow diagram of it and also add some diagrams to sow thae flow and architecture of that code arhitecture, in which we are using index.ts file to start the code after which it goes to the router layer and from their based on api repath it goes to that particulr controller after this in controller layer taking all of the data from user or required detais and validating all the data it goes to the main business logic and in controller layer is is also checking some checks such as all the desired values are in req.body, and also if this feild is pre exist in the db too, and after checking all this details it goes towards the interactor 
It goes to the interactor interface only from their weather whoever implements that interactor req will go their , in interactor layer where all the main business logic is presents.
in this interactor their are we atke data from controller layer and after that taking repository and implemneting that repository interface we create that user with the help of repository 
in reposiroy we already have prodcut entity and already we have written sql commands for respective methods too 
and as soon as interactor layer gets the out put of create data from repositry it return backs to taht data and then controller layer will return the data coming from interactive layer
